# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning-

Project Overview
This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The system automatically identifies whether an email is spam or non-spam based on its textual content, improving email organization and reducing security risks.



Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook/ visual studio code.
GUI: Streamlit
Note: Streamlit isnâ€™t natively designed to run in Google Colab, but you can work around this by using ngrok or Cloudflared to expose the Streamlit app running on a Colab notebook to the web.



Prerequisites
Python 3.9+
pip or Conda for package management




1. Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/keyakarkun/Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning.git
cd spam-email-classification




2. Set up the environment:
Run in anaconda prompt

conda create -n spam_env python=3.9
conda activate spam_env


Using Conda:

conda install pandas
conda install scikit-learn



Using pip:
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn

Initailly you need to make only 2 files only that is .py file and .ipynb file. 
When you run .ipynb file the other 2 files .pkl will be automatically come. So you don't need to worry about that.
Don't forget to upload the csv file which is our dataset.
